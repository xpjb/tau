# Streaming QA — release on hold

Unreleased work after `9181388`. The user is sending QA notes while using 0.6.1.
Commits/pushes are permitted, but **do not package, publish, or send another release
until the user signals it**. The user subsequently requested minimal system use;
compilation, GUI sessions and test runs were stopped. Resume heavier verification
only when system load allows.

## Implemented

- Windows-style middle-button autoscroll: quick click latches, held press ends on
  release; dead zone and speed match Tau 1. Escape/click/wheel/focus loss cancel it.
- Wheel input accumulates a target, followed by a frame-rate-independent one-pole
  filter (65ms time constant). Idle rendering remains on-demand.
- Draggable right-hand transcript scrollbar, track paging, and sidebar scrollbar.
- Earlier history loads near the top automatically; no “Load earlier” button.
  Pages retain the visible anchor, including while a wheel animation is active.
- “Details”, with 12dp thinking/tool text and headers, 11dp section labels, versus
  16dp main chat text. Tool calls/results pair by call ID. Individual tools start
  collapsed; large Input/Output/Error sections also collapse like Tau 1.
- Clicking the same disclosure header opens/closes it. No bottom Collapse button.
  Expansion preferences survive parent collapse and are saved per chat. The clicked
  header is pinned during reflow, within scroll bounds.
- Copy/Fork/queue/local-message actions move to a right-click/long-press context
  menu. File transfer controls remain on attachment cards, as in Tau 1.
- Tau 1's exact send/paperclip/stop vector paths, centered at its icon sizes.
  Empty/offline send is disabled. Icons rasterize once per size/state, not per frame.
- Tau 1's context usage ring and formatted tooltip values. The opaque tooltip
  expands in X and Y (160ms), rather than fading; supports hover and click pinning.
- Selection starts/continues in transcript whitespace, spans multiple messages,
  scrolls at the edges, and copies projected text. No floating Copy button.
- Editing shortcuts prefer the layout's Latin shortcut, then physical keys for
  non-Latin/named-key layouts. This also fixes Wine's Ctrl+C mapping to a named
  volume key without produced text.

## Verification already completed before the resource pause

No new trivial input/API tests. Used the Windows development executable under
Wine/Vulkan against an isolated real taud with a temporary deterministic fixture;
no production service, stable app, or release installer was changed.

- Clippy (frontend, all targets, warnings denied) and Windows cross-build passed.
- Typed/sent a message; expanded Details and a tool, re-collapsed using the original
  header, confirmed the nested preference remained saved.
- Observed smaller thinking/tool labels and code, hidden tool outputs, red error
  tool header, context menus without a message action strip, and the new icons.
- Hovered/pinned the usage tooltip and confirmed formatted usage/capacity.
- Latched middle-click autoscroll, moved upward, canceled with Escape.
- Recorded a wheel burst at 60Hz: scrollbar Y decayed
  `459 → 452 → 447 → 444 → 442 → 441 → 440 → 439 → 438`, then stayed still.
- Selected from the blank left margin to the right margin across three messages;
  context-menu copy/paste retained all 613 characters. Ctrl+C separately copied
  a shorter selection after the keyboard-layout fallback correction.
- Dragged the scrollbar upward repeatedly across a 160-message fixture. Automatic
  50-event paging reached anchors History 116, 066, 016, then 000; no load button.
- Stopped this task's Wine, fixture daemon and private Xvfb after the resource request.

## Deferred verification / release gate

- A small saved-anchor guard was added during the final static review after builds
  stopped: an empty/unsynchronized frame must not overwrite a saved scroll position.
  Rebuild and check restart restoration, especially an anchor on an older page.
- Exercise held-middle release, focus-loss cancellation, section-level large output
  toggles, partial tooltip-animation frames, sidebar scroll and touch long-press.
- Rerun the existing suite, both Android builds, and physical Windows/DirectX/DPI
  acceptance when resources permit. Do not infer physical Windows acceptance from Wine.
- Check mixed empty/hidden transcript blocks and tools straddling page boundaries
  against Tau 1 before declaring full presentation parity.
- Wait for the explicit release signal before version bumps, installer packaging,
  publication, or sending artifacts. No new release was produced for this batch.
